# MoltBot Crux

MoltBot Crux is a focused starter project that shows my understanding of conversational AI systems, intent-based logic, and prompt-driven workflows.

This repository serves as a practical example of how I design and structure AI bots using MoltBot. My goal is to use these skills in a real-world internship environment.

## Purpose of This Project

The main goal of MoltBot Crux is to act as:
- A skill demonstration for AI and automation internships
- A foundation for creating production-ready conversational bots
- A hands-on exploration of AI system design, not just theory

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Intent-based query handling
- Basic NLP-style preprocessing
- Prompt structuring for AI responses
- Clean, modular bot logic
- Complete conversational flow

This project focuses on AI workflow and design thinking instead of heavy model training.

---

## How It Works

1. User inputs a query.
2. The system detects intent using keyword-based logic.
3. A structured response strategy is applied.
4. The bot returns a clear and relevant reply.
